The previous example introduced concurrency. This is a specific characteristics of real world systems. In fact, a general system has many thing happening in the same time or with some kind of dependency one to the other (i.e on the positive edge of the clock something on a signal happens).

SystemC supports events, which are used to exploit concurrency based design. 

The example implements a design with an event driven counter. The two design are really similar, there are only a few difference:

1) Initialization of the event: To use the event we need to initialized them inside our module. This is done in the following way:
    ```cpp
    SC_MODULE(counter) {
        // ...
        sc_event increment_cnt;
        // ...
    }
    ```
2) Changing the `count_thread` method by adapting the `wait()` function to wait for the signal and not for a specific time interval. 
    ```cpp
    void count_thread() {
        while (true) {
            // ...
            wait(increment_cnt);
        }
    }
    ```
    This is really easy, since we just pass the signal as a parameter of the `wait()` method. 

3) Write a `SC_METHOD` (or `SC_THREAD`) that triggers the signal. 
    ```cpp
    void trigger_increment_cnt() {
        increment_cnt.notify();
        next_trigger(10, SC_NS);
    }
    ```
    This function executes the `notify()` method on the signal, which IMMEDIATELY triggers the signal. Then, since `trigger_increment_cnt()` is a method, it is rescheduled after 10ns.

The output of the program is the expected one:

```
Counter initialized
TIME @0 s THREAD: Counter value: 0
Incrementing counter inside THREAD
TIME @10 ns THREAD: Counter value: 1
Incrementing counter inside THREAD
TIME @20 ns THREAD: Counter value: 2
Incrementing counter inside THREAD
TIME @30 ns THREAD: Counter value: 3
Incrementing counter inside THREAD
TIME @40 ns THREAD: Counter value: 4
Incrementing counter inside THREAD
Simulation ending @50 ns
```

So we get exactly the same behaviour but by using events.
